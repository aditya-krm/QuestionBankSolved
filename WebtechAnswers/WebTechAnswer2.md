2. Define callback function in Node.js

## Callback Functions in Node.js: A Simple Explanation

In Node.js, a callback function is essentially a function that you pass as an argument to another function. This other function then invokes (calls back) your passed-in function, usually after it has completed its own task. 

**Why are they used?**

Node.js heavily relies on asynchronous operations. This means tasks don't happen one after the other; instead, they run concurrently. So, while one task is running, another can start before the first one finishes. Callback functions help manage this flow by letting the first function "call back" your function when it's done, ensuring things happen in the right order.

**Structure of a Callback Function:**

```javascript
function myCallbackFunction(error, data) {
  if (error) {
    // Handle error
  } else {
    // Use the data
  }
}

// Example of using the callback
someAsyncFunction(arg1, arg2, myCallbackFunction);
```

**Key Points:**

*   The callback function typically takes two arguments:
    *   `error`: This holds any error information if the async operation failed.
    *   `data`: This holds the result of the async operation if it succeeded.
*   Error handling is crucial within the callback to deal with potential issues during the async operation.
*   You define what happens with the result (data) inside the callback.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine you're reading a file. You initiate the file reading, but it takes time. Instead of waiting, your program can continue with other tasks. Once the file reading is complete, your callback function is triggered, and you can then process the file content.
