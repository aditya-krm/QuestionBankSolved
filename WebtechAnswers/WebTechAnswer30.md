## State vs. Props in React: Understanding the Key Differences

Both state and props play crucial roles in managing data within React components, but they serve distinct purposes and behave differently. Let's break down their core differences:

**1. Mutability:**

* **State:** Mutable and dynamic. Components can change their own state over time using the `setState()` method. This triggers re-rendering, reflecting updates in the UI.
* **Props:** Immutable and static. They are passed down from parent components and cannot be directly modified by the child component receiving them. To update props, changes must occur in the parent component.

**2. Data Ownership:**

* **State:** Owned and managed by the component itself. It's private data specific to that component.
* **Props:** Owned by the parent component. They are a way for the parent to pass data down to its children.

**3. Usage:**

* **State:** Ideal for handling data that changes over time due to user interactions or other events within the component, such as:
    * User input values
    * Active/selected items
    * Timer values
    * UI states (e.g., open/closed menus)
* **Props:** Used to pass data from parent to child components, often for configuration or initial values, such as:
    * Text content
    * Styling information
    * Data fetched from an API
    * Options for a component

**4. Data Flow:**

* **State:** Flows downwards. Changes in a component's state will trigger re-rendering of that component and its children.
* **Props:** Also flow downwards. A parent component's state can be passed down as props to its children.

**In a nutshell:**

* **State:** Internal and dynamic data specific to a component.
* **Props:** External and static data passed from parent to child components. 

**Remember:** Using state and props effectively is key to building well-structured and maintainable React applications.
