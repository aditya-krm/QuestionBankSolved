# Question:

13. Write down the use of nvm.

# Answer:

## nvm: Node Version Manager

**nvm (Node Version Manager)** is a command-line tool used to manage multiple active Node.js versions on a single machine. It allows you to:

* **Install and switch between different Node.js versions:** This is particularly helpful when working on projects that require specific Node.js versions or when you want to test your code with different versions.
* **Manage multiple Node.js environments:** You can create isolated environments with different Node.js versions and packages, preventing conflicts between projects.
* **Easily upgrade or downgrade Node.js versions:** nvm simplifies the process of updating or rolling back to a previous version.
* **Test your code with different Node.js versions:** This helps ensure compatibility and identify potential issues. 
* **Install and manage global npm packages for each Node.js version:**  This allows you to keep dependencies separate for different projects and Node.js versions.
