26. Describe the purpose and use of the "require" function in Node.js.

# Answer:

## The "require" Function in Node.js

In Node.js, the `require` function is a fundamental tool used for **importing modules**. Modules are like building blocks of code that contain functions, objects, or variables that can be reused in different parts of your application. 

Here's how it works:

**1. Importing Modules:**

- You use `require` with the path or name of the module you want to import. 
- Node.js searches for the module in various locations like the core modules, file system, or node_modules folder.
- Once found, the module is loaded and executed, and its exports become accessible to your current file.

**Example:**

```javascript
const fs = require('fs'); // Importing the built-in 'fs' module

fs.readFile('myfile.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});
```

**2. Module Types:**

- **Built-in Modules:** Node.js comes with several built-in modules like `fs` (file system), `http` (for creating web servers), and `path` (for working with file paths). 
- **Third-party Modules:** You can install external modules from the npm registry using the `npm install` command. These modules offer additional functionalities like database access, web frameworks, etc.
- **Custom Modules:** You can create your own modules and import them using relative or absolute paths.

**3. Caching:**

- Node.js caches the modules you require for efficiency. 
- This means that the module is loaded only once, and subsequent `require` calls will return the cached version.

**4. CommonJS Module System:**

- Node.js uses the CommonJS module system, where each file is treated as a separate module.
- The `exports` object within a module is used to define what is exposed to other modules.

**In summary, the `require` function is essential for building modular and maintainable Node.js applications by enabling code reuse and separation of concerns.**
