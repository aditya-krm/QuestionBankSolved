## Point-to-Point Connection for Local Calls

A local telephone call between two parties establishes a **point-to-point connection**. This means a dedicated communication path exists directly between the two telephones involved in the call. No other phones or devices are directly part of this connection.

**Explanation:**

* **Dedicated Path:** When you dial a local number, the telephone switching system establishes a direct electrical circuit between your phone and the recipient's phone. This circuit is exclusive to your call and is not shared with any other ongoing calls.
* **No Intermediate Devices:** The call doesn't pass through any other phones or devices on its way to the destination. It goes directly from point A (your phone) to point B (the other person's phone).
* **Single Sender & Receiver:** Only two parties are involved in the communication - the caller and the receiver. 

This is in contrast to a **multipoint connection**, where multiple devices share the same communication channel, like in a conference call or a television broadcast.
