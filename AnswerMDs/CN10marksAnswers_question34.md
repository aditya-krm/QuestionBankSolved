## Analyzing Four Interleaved Sources

We are given four sources, each generating 250 characters per second, with interleaving at the character level and 1 synchronizing bit added per frame. Let's analyze the scenario step-by-step:

**(a) Data rate of each source:**

* Each source generates 250 characters/second.
* Assuming each character is 8 bits (standard ASCII), the data rate per source is: 250 characters/second * 8 bits/character = 2000 bits/second.

**(b) Duration of each character in each source:**

* This is simply the inverse of the character rate: 1 / 250 characters/second = 0.004 seconds/character = 4 milliseconds/character.

**(c) Frame rate:**

* Since interleaving happens at the character level and each source contributes one character per frame, the frame rate is equal to the character rate of a single source: 250 frames/second.

**(d) Duration of each frame:**

* Similar to character duration, the frame duration is the inverse of the frame rate: 1 / 250 frames/second = 0.004 seconds/frame = 4 milliseconds/frame.

**(e) Number of bits in each frame:**

* Each frame contains 4 characters (one from each source) and 1 synchronizing bit.
* Total bits per frame = (4 characters * 8 bits/character) + 1 synchronizing bit = 33 bits/frame.

**(f) Data rate of the link:**

* The link transmits 250 frames/second, each containing 33 bits.
* Therefore, the data rate of the link is: 250 frames/second * 33 bits/frame = 8250 bits/second. 
 
 

**Summary:**

* Each source transmits at 2000 bits/second.
* Each character takes 4 milliseconds.
* The frame rate is 250 frames/second, with each frame lasting 4 milliseconds.
* Each frame contains 33 bits.
* The overall data rate of the link is 8250 bits/second.
