## IPv4 and IPv6 Addressing: A Comparison

### IPv4 and Dotted Decimal Notation:

*   **Dotted decimal notation** is the human-readable representation of an IPv4 address. It consists of four decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots (periods). 
*   Each number represents a byte (8 bits) of the address. 
*   Therefore, an IPv4 address in dotted decimal notation has **4 bytes**. 
*   **Example:** `192.168.1.1`

### IPv6 and Hexadecimal Notation:

*   **Hexadecimal notation** is used to represent IPv6 addresses in a more compact and readable format. 
*   IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long and are divided into eight 16-bit blocks. 
*   Each block is represented by four hexadecimal digits (0-9, A-F). 
*   Therefore, an IPv6 address in hexadecimal notation has **32 hexadecimal digits**.
*   **Example:** `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`
