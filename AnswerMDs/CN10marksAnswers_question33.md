## Answer 34: IP Addressing

### a. First and Last Address in the Block

Given the IP address 25.34.12.56/16, we can determine the network address and broadcast address as follows:

* **Network Mask:** A /16 indicates the first 16 bits are the network portion, so the mask is 255.255.0.0.
* **Network Address:** Apply the mask to the IP address using a bitwise AND operation. This gives us 25.34.0.0 as the network address.
* **Broadcast Address:** Invert the network mask (0.0.255.255) and perform a bitwise OR operation with the IP address. This results in 25.34.255.255 as the broadcast address.

Therefore, the first address (network address) is **25.34.0.0** and the last address (broadcast address) is **25.34.255.255**.

### b. Classful vs. Classless Addressing

**Classful Addressing:**

* **Fixed Class Sizes:** Divides the IP address space into five classes (A, B, C, D, E) with predefined sizes and network portions.
* **Wasteful:** Can lead to inefficient use of address space, as organizations may not perfectly fit into the fixed class sizes.
* **Limited Flexibility:** Restricts the number of networks and hosts within each class.
* **Simple:** Easy to understand and implement.

**Classless Addressing:**

* **Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM):** Allows dividing the IP address space into variable-sized subnets based on specific needs.
* **Efficient:** Optimizes address space utilization by allocating addresses according to the actual number of hosts required.
* **Flexible:** Provides greater control over network design and addressing.
* **Complex:** Requires more planning and management compared to classful addressing.

**Summary:**

Classless addressing offers greater flexibility and efficiency in address allocation compared to classful addressing. While it involves more complexity, it is the preferred method for modern IP networks.
