## Hybrid Topology Designs:

### a. Star Backbone with Three Ring Networks:

**Components:**

*   **Central Switch:** Acts as the core of the star, connecting to three separate ring networks.
*   **Ring Networks:** Each ring consists of multiple devices connected in a closed loop.

**Connections:**

1.  **Central Switch to Rings:** Each ring network connects to the central switch via a single link. This creates the star topology backbone.
2.  **Within Rings:** Devices within each ring are connected to their two immediate neighbors, forming the ring structure.

**Advantages:**

*   **Centralized Management:** The central switch simplifies network management and troubleshooting.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** If one device in a ring fails, the data can still flow through the rest of the ring, and other rings remain unaffected.
*   **Scalability:** New devices can be easily added to any of the rings without disrupting the overall network.

**Disadvantages:**

*   **Single Point of Failure:** If the central switch fails, the entire network goes down.
*   **Increased Cost:** The central switch can be expensive, and additional cabling is required compared to a simple ring topology.

**Diagram:**

   in a      in a       in a 
   ring)      ring)      ring)
```

### b. Ring Backbone with Two Bus Networks:

**Components:**

*   **Ring Backbone:** A series of devices connected in a closed loop, forming the main network structure.
*   **Bus Networks:** Two linear networks where devices are connected to a single cable.

**Connections:**

1.  **Ring to Bus:** Each bus network connects to the ring backbone at a single point.
2.  **Within Buses:** Devices within each bus network are connected to the same cable.

**Advantages:**

*   **Fault Tolerance:** If one device in the ring backbone fails, data can still flow through the rest of the ring.
*   **Easy Expansion:** New devices can be easily added to the bus networks without disrupting the ring backbone.
*   **Cost-Effective:** Bus networks are simple and inexpensive to implement.

**Disadvantages:**

*   **Limited Scalability:** Bus networks can become congested with too many devices.
*   **Single Point of Failure:** If the cable in a bus network fails, the entire bus network goes down.
*   **Collision Detection:** Devices on a bus network must contend for access to the cable, which can lead to collisions and reduced performance.
