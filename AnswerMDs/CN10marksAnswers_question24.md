## Why Port Numbers Instead of Process IDs?

While process IDs (PIDs) seem like a logical choice for identifying destination entities, there are two key reasons why UDP and TCP opted for port numbers:

**1. Security and Abstraction:**

*   **Process IDs are specific to a particular operating system and machine.** Using PIDs would tie the protocol to a specific OS, hindering cross-platform communication. Port numbers provide a platform-agnostic abstraction layer, enabling communication between diverse systems.
*   **Exposing PIDs could pose security risks.** A malicious actor could potentially exploit knowledge of PIDs to target specific processes and gain unauthorized access. Port numbers offer an additional layer of security by hiding the internal process structure.

**2. Dynamic Allocation and Multiplexing:**

*   **Process IDs are typically assigned sequentially and can change over time.** This dynamic nature makes them unreliable for identifying services, as the PID associated with a service could change after a system reboot or process termination. Port numbers, on the other hand, can be statically assigned to specific services, ensuring consistent identification.
*   **Multiple processes might need to offer the same service.** Port numbers allow for multiplexing, where different processes on the same machine can listen on the same port number, each handling a separate connection for the same service. This wouldn't be possible with unique PIDs.
