## Spanning Tree with Root Bridge B1:

**Assumptions:**

* We'll use the basic Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) for this scenario.
* Each bridge has a unique Bridge ID (BID) where B1 has the lowest BID, making it the root bridge.

**Steps:**

1. **Root Bridge Selection:** B1 is already chosen as the root bridge.

2. **Path Cost Calculation:** Each bridge calculates the path cost to the root bridge. Since B1 is the root, its cost is 0. B2 and B4 directly connect to B1, so their cost is 1. B3 connects to B1 via either B2 or B4, resulting in a cost of 2.

3. **Port Roles:**
    * **Root Port:** Each non-root bridge selects one port with the lowest cost to the root bridge as the Root Port. 
        * B2: Port connected to B1 becomes the Root Port.
        * B3: Port connected to either B2 or B4 (depending on the specific port costs) becomes the Root Port.
        * B4: Port connected to B1 becomes the Root Port.
    * **Designated Port:** On each LAN segment, the port with the lowest path cost to the root bridge becomes the Designated Port. All ports on the root bridge are Designated Ports.
        * LAN 1: B1's port is the Designated Port.
        * LAN 2: B1's port is the Designated Port.
        * LAN 3: B2's port (assuming it has a lower path cost than B4's port to reach B1) is the Designated Port.
    * **Blocked Port:** All other ports are put in Blocking state to prevent loops.
        * B3: The port not chosen as the Root Port (connected to either B2 or B4) is Blocked.
        * B4: Ports connected to LAN 2 and LAN 3 are Blocked.

**Resulting Topology:**

* **LAN 1:** B1 (Designated Port) - B2 (Root Port) - B4 (Blocked Port)
* **LAN 2:** B1 (Designated Port) - B3 (Root Port or Blocked Port) - B4 (Blocked Port)
* **LAN 3:** B2 (Designated Port) - B3 (Root Port or Blocked Port) - B4 (Blocked Port)

**Summary:**

This configuration ensures a loop-free topology with B1 as the central point of traffic flow. B2 and B3 act as intermediary bridges, while B4's ports are blocked to prevent loops.
