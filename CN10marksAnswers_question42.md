## FDM Configuration for Four 1 Mbps Data Channels on a 1 MHz Satellite Channel

Here's how we can design an appropriate configuration using Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM):

**1. Channel Bandwidth:**

*   Each data channel requires 1 Mbps of bandwidth.
*   We need to allocate guard bands between channels to prevent interference. Let's assume a guard band of 0.1 MHz for each channel.

**2. Total Bandwidth Required:**

*   Data channels: 4 channels * 1 Mbps/channel = 4 Mbps
*   Guard bands: 4 channels * 0.1 MHz/channel = 0.4 MHz
*   Total: 4 Mbps + 0.4 MHz = 4.4 MHz

**3. Modulation:**

*   Since the total required bandwidth (4.4 MHz) is less than the available satellite channel bandwidth (1 MHz), we can use a simple modulation scheme like BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying) for each data channel. BPSK requires a bandwidth equal to the data rate, which is 1 MHz in this case.

**4. Frequency Allocation:**

*   We will divide the 1 MHz satellite channel into four sub-channels, each with a bandwidth of 1.1 MHz (1 MHz for data + 0.1 MHz guard band).
*   Assign each data channel to one of the sub-channels with the following center frequencies:
    *   Channel 1: 0.55 MHz
    *   Channel 2: 1.65 MHz
    *   Channel 3: 2.75 MHz
    *   Channel 4: 3.85 MHz

                                 |                   |
                                 |                   |
                 --------------   |                   |   --------------
                |   Channel 1  |   |                   |   |   Channel 4  |
                |  (0.55 MHz)  |   |                   |   |  (3.85 MHz)  | 
                 --------------   |                   |   --------------
                                 |                   |
                 --------------   |                   |   --------------
                |   Channel 2  |   |                   |   |   Channel 3  |
                |  (1.65 MHz)  |   |                   |   |  (2.75 MHz)  | 
                 --------------   |                   |   --------------
                                 |                   |
                                 |                   |
                                 ---------------------
```

**6. Additional Considerations:**

*   Synchronization: Ensure all transmitters and receivers are synchronized to maintain proper channel spacing and avoid interference.
*   Filtering: Use appropriate filters at the transmitter and receiver to limit the signal bandwidth and minimize interference between channels.
*   Power control: Adjust the transmission power of each channel to optimize signal quality and avoid overloading the satellite transponder.

**7. Advantages of FDM:**

*   Simple implementation.
*   Efficient use of bandwidth.
*   Allows simultaneous transmission of multiple signals.

**8. Disadvantages of FDM:**

*   Susceptible to intermodulation distortion if not properly designed.
*   Requires guard bands, which reduce spectral efficiency.
*   Limited flexibility in allocating bandwidth to channels with varying data rates.
