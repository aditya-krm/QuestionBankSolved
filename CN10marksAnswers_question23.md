## Character Encoding and Framing Methods

Here's the bit sequence transmitted for the four-character frame "A B ESC FLAG" using the given character encoding and different framing methods:

**(a) Byte Count:**

* In byte count framing, the first byte indicates the number of characters in the frame (excluding the count itself). 
* So, the first byte would be "00000100" (binary for 4). 
* Following this, we have the encoded characters and no additional framing characters.

Therefore, the transmitted bit sequence is:

```
00000100 01000111 11100011 11100000 01111110
```

**(b) Flag Bytes with Byte Stuffing:**

* The frame is delimited by "FLAG" bytes (01111110). 
* However, if the FLAG pattern appears within the data, it needs to be stuffed with an "ESC" byte (11100000) to avoid misinterpretation.

The transmitted bit sequence is:

```
01111110 01000111 11100011 11100000 11100000 01111110
```

Notice that we inserted an "ESC" byte before the "ESC" character in the data.

**(c) Starting and Ending Flag Bytes with Bit Stuffing:**

* Similar to (b), the frame starts and ends with "FLAG" bytes.
* However, instead of byte stuffing, we use bit stuffing. 
* After five consecutive "1" bits are encountered within the data, a "0" bit is stuffed to prevent accidental FLAG sequences.

The transmitted bit sequence is:

```
01111110 01000111 11100011 11100000 11100000 01111110
```

In this case, no bit stuffing was needed because there were no sequences of five consecutive "1" bits within the data.
