35.We have four sources, each creating 250 characters per second. If the interleaved unit is a character and 1 synchronizing bit is added
to each frame, find (a) the data rate of each source, (b) the duration of each character in each source, (c) the frame rate, (d) the
duration of each frame, (e) the number of bits in each frame, and (f) the data rate of the link.
