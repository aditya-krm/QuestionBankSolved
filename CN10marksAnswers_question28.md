## Analyzing Periodic Signals and Their Bandwidth

### a. Signal with 20 Hz Bandwidth

We know the bandwidth is the difference between the highest and lowest frequencies in a signal. Therefore, with a bandwidth of 20 Hz and a highest frequency of 60 Hz, the lowest frequency would be:

Lowest frequency = Highest frequency - Bandwidth = 60 Hz - 20 Hz = 40 Hz

So, the signal spans from 40 Hz to 60 Hz.

**Spectrum:**

Since all frequencies have the same amplitude, the spectrum would be a flat line between 40 Hz and 60 Hz on the frequency axis, with the amplitude being the same for all points within that range.

### b. Signal with Five Sine Waves

The bandwidth is determined by the difference between the highest and lowest frequency components. In this case:

Bandwidth = Highest frequency - Lowest frequency = 900 Hz - 100 Hz = 800 Hz

**Spectrum:**

The spectrum would consist of five vertical lines at the frequencies 100 Hz, 300 Hz, 500 Hz, 700 Hz, and 900 Hz. Each line would reach an amplitude of 10 V, representing the maximum amplitude of each sine wave component.
