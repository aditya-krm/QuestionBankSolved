## Network Examples: Bandwidth and Latency

### High Bandwidth, High Latency: Satellite Internet

Satellite internet connections often boast impressive bandwidth capabilities, allowing for high data transfer rates. However, due to the vast distances the signal must travel between Earth and satellites in geostationary orbit, latency is inherently high. This delay can be noticeable in activities sensitive to real-time responsiveness, such as online gaming or video conferencing.

### Low Bandwidth, Low Latency: Local Area Network (LAN)

A local area network within a home or office building typically exhibits both low bandwidth and low latency. While the data transfer rates may not be as high as those offered by satellite internet, the distances data packets travel are significantly shorter, resulting in minimal delays. This makes LANs ideal for applications where real-time responsiveness is crucial, such as file sharing or multiplayer gaming within the same network.
