## Analyzing Delay Sensitivity in Internet Applications:

**13.** Among the given options, **c. Surfing the Internet** is the most sensitive to delay. Let's break down why:

* **a. Sending an e-mail:** Email transmission is generally tolerant of delays. The process involves sending a message to a server, which then relays it to the recipient's server. Delays of a few seconds or even minutes usually have minimal impact on the overall experience. 
* **b. Copying a file:** Similar to email, file copying involves transferring data between devices or across a network. While delays can affect the transfer speed, the process is not as interactive and time-sensitive as surfing the web. Users can generally tolerate some delay as long as the file eventually transfers successfully.
* **c. Surfing the Internet:** Web browsing involves a constant back-and-forth exchange of data between your device and web servers. This includes loading web pages, images, videos, and other content. Delays in this process directly impact user experience, leading to slow loading times, choppy video playback, and frustration. 

Therefore, due to its real-time and interactive nature, surfing the internet is more sensitive to delays compared to sending emails or copying files.

## Baseband vs. Broadband Transmission:

**14.** 

* **a. Sending a digital signal on a LAN:** This is **baseband transmission**. In baseband, the digital signal is sent directly over the medium without any modulation. This is typical for LAN technologies like Ethernet, where data is transmitted as digital pulses.
* **b. Modulating several voice signals and sending them through the air:** This is **broadband transmission**.  Voice signals are analog, and to transmit them through the air (wireless transmission), they need to be modulated onto a carrier frequency. This allows multiple signals to be transmitted simultaneously over different frequency ranges within a larger bandwidth. 

**In essence, baseband transmission directly sends the digital signal, while broadband transmission involves modulating the signal onto a carrier frequency for efficient use of the medium.**
