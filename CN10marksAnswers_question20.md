## Wireless Station Communication Analysis

### (a) A Sending to B: Possible Communications

When A is sending to B, the following communications are possible:

* **D can communicate with E:** Since A is already occupying the channel with B, C cannot communicate with either A or B. However, D and E have a separate communication channel and can communicate with each other without interference.

### (b) B Sending to A: Possible Communications

When B is sending to A, the following communications are possible:

* **D can communicate with C:** Similar to the previous scenario, B and A occupy one communication channel. This leaves D and C free to communicate with each other without interference.

### (c) B Sending to C: Possible Communications

When B is sending to C, **no other communication is possible**. This is because:

* **A cannot communicate with anyone:**  A shares communication channels with both B and C. Therefore, A cannot communicate with any other station while B and C are communicating.
* **D and E cannot communicate:** Both D and E require communication with either B or C, which are currently occupied. 

Therefore, B sending to C essentially blocks all other communication between the stations.
