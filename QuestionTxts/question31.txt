32.  a. Host A wants to send 10 frames to Host B. The host uses SR-ARQ. How many frames are transmitted by Host A if every 6thframe is lost? Assume the timer is appropriately large enough that we do not run into the same problems we ran into for the
problem solved in class.
Compare the number of transmissions for SR-ARQ and Go back 4 ARQ. [6]
b. In SR protocol, suppose frames through 0 to 4 have been transmitted. Now, imagine that 0 times out, 5 (a new frame) is
transmitted, 1 times out, 2 times out and 6 (another new frame) is transmitted.
At this point, what will be the outstanding packets in senderâ€™s window? [4]
