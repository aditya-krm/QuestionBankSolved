## Analyzing the Given Network and Distance Vector Routing

Unfortunately, I cannot process images or diagrams directly. To analyze the network and determine unused links and final routing tables using the Distance Vector Routing algorithm, I'll need you to provide the network information in a text format. 

Please provide the following details:

1. **Router Names:** List the names or identifiers of the 4 routers (e.g., A, B, C, D).
2. **Connections:** Describe the connections between routers. For each connection, specify the two connected routers and the cost of the link between them.

**Example Format:**

```
Routers: A, B, C, D

Connections:
- A to B with cost 2
- A to C with cost 5
- B to C with cost 1
- B to D with cost 4
- C to D with cost 3 
```

Once you provide this information, I can help you determine the unused links and calculate the final routing tables for each router using the Distance Vector Routing algorithm.
