30.  Suppose we want to transmit the message 11001001 (P(x) = x 7 + X6 +x X3 + 1) and protect it from errors using the CRC polynomialC(x) = x 3 + 1. [4+3+3]
Answer the below questions:
a. Use polynomial long division to determine the message that should be transmitted.
b. Suppose the leftmost bit of the message is inverted due to noise on the transmission link. What is the result of the receiverâ€™s
CRC calculation? How does the receiver know that an error has occurred?
Give an example of the error which cannot be detected by CRC. Is there a general pattern for undetectable errors?
